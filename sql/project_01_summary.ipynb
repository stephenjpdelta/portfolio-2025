    "The dataset contains polling results for AHCA-related questions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It includes the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Start** — Poll start date  \n",
    "- **End** — Poll end date  \n",
    "- **Pollster** — Name of the polling organisation  \n",
    "- **Favor** — Percentage who favour the AHCA  \n",
    "- **Oppose** — Percentage who oppose the AHCA  \n",
    "- **Url** — Link to poll source (may be missing)  \n",
    "- **Text** — Exact survey wording  \n",

    "The SQL script answers a range of analytical questions, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many polls are in the dataset?  \n",
    "- How many distinct pollsters are there?  \n",
    "- Which pollsters are most active?  \n",
    "- What are the overall averages of Favor and Oppose?  \n",
    "- Which pollsters show the highest support or opposition?  \n",
    "- What is the earliest and most recent poll?  \n",
    "- How do favor/oppose levels vary by month?  \n",
    "- What distinct question texts appear?  \n",
    "- Which polls explicitly mention “health care”?  \n",
    "- Which polls show Favor > Oppose (and vice versa)?  \n",
    "- Are there polls with unusual totals (Favor + Oppose < 75 or > 95)?  \n",
    "- How many polls are missing URLs?  \n",

    "The SQL analysis uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggregation:** COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX  \n",
    "- **Grouping:** GROUP BY for pollster-level and monthly trends  \n",
    "- **Filtering:** WHERE for text search, missing URLs, and opinion comparisons  \n",
    "- **Ordering & limiting:** ORDER BY, LIMIT  \n",
    "- **String functions:** SUBSTR() for month extraction  \n",
    "- **Data quality checks:** Identifying missing URLs and odd value totals  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notable patterns include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Several pollsters appear frequently, showing uneven representation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Average levels of **Oppose** tend to exceed **Favor** across most polls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- A subset of polls show very high opposition levels (top Oppose > 70%).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Monthly trends indicate shifts over time in public support/opposition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- URLs are missing for a number of polls, indicating incomplete metadata.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Question wording varies widely; some mention “health care” directly while others do not.  \n",
